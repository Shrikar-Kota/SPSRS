Our college’s Physical Education department customarily organize and carry out physical
activities for students of different departments by following a weekly schedule, besides that the
Physical Education department also collects student’s anthropometrical data, examines it and
follows through a short counselling session where students who require advice on being healthy
or need to bring changes which bring a fit dividend in their lifestyle is carried out.

In the present system, the records of student information and their anthropometrical data are taken
manually onto a sheet of paper and later collected. This is not the best alternative to continue with
when there are more than 4000 students in a college. This application will give them a web portal
which will eliminate paperwork.

This project is to create a user-expedient web application for our college’s Physical Education
Department so they can preserve records of all student’s anthropometric data like height, weight,
BMI, and age in an easily accessible way, insert records when obligatory, generate individual
student progress reports with faculty’s personal feedback, visualize the records into graphs to get
better insights and view student’s formal feedbacks and suggestions.
